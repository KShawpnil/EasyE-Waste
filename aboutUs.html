        <p>The growing popularity and sustainability of Eco-friendliness
            require considering the production of electronic equipment with efficient
            and strategic e-waste management planning. Recent studies proposed dif-
            ferent models and techniques for e-waste management. Based on those,
            this paper introduces a novel approach to the sustainable management
            of e-waste. Proposed two different architectures; the first one is generic,
            where e-waste separation steps are highlighted, followed by the after-
            work management employing mycoremediation and phytoremediation,
            resulting in proper recycling, reusing, and reducing. The other is soft-
            ware, which focuses on equipment quality improvement for environmen-
            tal sustainability. The approach is supported using a mathematical model
            of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to analyze the importance of e-
            waste based on customer requirements. Successful implementation of our
            proposed approach is demonstrated using a further graphical represen-
            tation.</p>
